# Just a Bunch of Recipes

### Welcome! This is the code that backs my simple, no-fuss recipe website: www.justabunchofrecipes.com

On the site you'll find my personal go-to recipes, along with some of my family's classics and a few recipes from friends. You'll find no ads here, and you'll never have to scroll through my life story to get to a recipe.

On each recipe page, there are a few neat features I want to point out!
- At the top of many of the recipes, you'll find buttons that allow you to make the recipe vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. Clicking any of these buttons will immediately update the recipe's ingredients and steps to match your selected dietary restriction so you don't have to keep track of substitutions in your head!
- Below the image on each recipe, you'll find two small buttons:
  - Print: the first button creates a printer-friendly version of the recipe and opens a print window to either save or print that version.
  - Copy Ingredients: the second button copies the list of ingredients for easily adding to a grocery list.
- When browsing recipes, you can quickly search and filter the list of recipes to find what you're looking for. In particular, if you select a dietary restriction filter (vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free), the site will display all recipes that either already meet that restriction or provide the button to make the recipe meet that restriction.
